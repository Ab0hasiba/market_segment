# Market Segmentation Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive market segmentation analysis project using machine learning techniques to identify distinct customer segments.

## Project Overview

The project analyzes customer data to identify meaningful market segments using clustering algorithms, specifically K-Means clustering. This helps businesses understand their customer base and develop targeted marketing strategies.

## Files Included

- `Market_Segmentation_Customer_Data_FINAL.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- `Customer Data.csv` - Original customer dataset
- `Clustered_Customer_Data.csv` - Processed data with cluster assignments
- `final_model.sav` - Trained machine learning model
- `kmeans_model.pkl` - K-Means clustering model
- `scaler.pkl` - Data preprocessing scaler
- `feature_order.pkl` - Feature ordering for model consistency

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
- Model persistence for future predictions
- Comprehensive data visualization
- Statistical analysis of customer segments

## Usage

1. Load the Jupyter notebook to explore the analysis
2. Use the trained models for new customer predictions
3. Analyze the clustered data for business insights

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Results

The analysis identifies distinct customer segments based on various behavioral and demographic features, enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved customer understanding.
